- **Message Validation**: Comprehensive frame validation for all message types
- **Service Compatibility**: All existing services (broker, identity, state) now working with v0.2

#### Breaking Changes Resolution
During the MDP v0.2 upgrade, several breaking changes were introduced that required immediate resolution:

**Issues Identified:**
- Services failing on startup with protocol validation errors
- Raw byte commands (`\x01`, `\x05`) instead of human-readable strings
- Incorrect validation function usage in worker-to-broker messages
- Memory issues and socket cleanup problems
- **Critical Post-Upgrade Issue**: Client-to-broker communication completely failed due to ZeroMQ frame structure mismatch
- **Identity Service Configuration Issue**: Identity service not properly responding to client authentication requests due to broker message routing bug

**Fixes Implemented:**
- ✅ **Command Constants**: Converted from `string(rune(0x01))` to `"READY"` format
- ✅ **Validation Functions**: Fixed worker to use `ValidateWorkerMessage` instead of `ValidateBrokerToWorkerMessage`
- ✅ **Protocol Compatibility**: Updated all services to use MDP v0.2 message format
- ✅ **Integration Testing**: Verified broker ↔ identity service connectivity
- ✅ **Frame Structure Fix**: Resolved critical client communication failure by adding empty delimiter frame to client messages and fixing broker command frame processing (see `docs/reports/mdp-framing-issue-resolution.md`)
- ✅ **Broker Message Routing Fix**: Fixed broker to properly strip command frames from client messages before routing to services, enabling complete end-to-end authentication flow

**Result**: All services now successfully connect and communicate using MDP v0.2 protocol with human-readable commands, proper frame validation, complete client-broker communication functionality, and fully working identity service authentication. The identity service is now properly configured to respond to client requests.

- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services are offline
- **JSON Response Format**: Consistent output format matching MDP commands

**Available Commands**:
```bash
# State operations via gRPC
plant-grpc state state-grpc get <key> --service=<scope> --grpc-endpoint=http://localhost:8080
plant-grpc state state-grpc set <key> <value> --service=<scope> --grpc-endpoint=http://localhost:8080
plant-grpc state state-grpc list --service=<scope> --grpc-endpoint=http://localhost:8080
plant-grpc state state-grpc list-scopes --grpc-endpoint=http://localhost:8080

# Authentication via gRPC  
plant-grpc auth auth-grpc login --grpc-endpoint=http://localhost:8080
plant-grpc auth auth-grpc status --grpc-endpoint=http://localhost:8080
plant-grpc auth auth-grpc whoami --grpc-endpoint=http://localhost:8080
```

### Phase 6: Integration Testing ✅ COMPLETE
**Deliverables**: Comprehensive testing framework for end-to-end validation of the complete gRPC system

**Completed Components**:
1. **Integration Test Suite** (`scripts/test-integration.sh`):
   - End-to-end state operations testing through Traefik gateway
   - Authentication flow validation
   - Error handling and resilience testing
   - Concurrent operations testing
   - Performance benchmarking (60+ ops/sec baseline)
   - MDP compatibility validation

2. **Load Testing Framework** (`scripts/test-load.sh`):
   - Configurable concurrent user simulation (default: 10 users)
   - Configurable operations per user (default: 100 operations)
   - Gradual ramp-up testing
   - Resource limit and connection pooling tests
   - Performance analysis and reporting
   - Customizable test parameters via command line

3. **Failure Scenario Testing** (`scripts/test-failure-scenarios.sh`):
   - Invalid endpoint handling validation
   - Network timeout scenario testing
   - Partial service failure testing
   - Concurrent failure isolation testing
   - System resilience assessment

4. **Migration Compatibility Testing** (`scripts/test-migration-compatibility.sh`):
   - Parallel MDP and gRPC protocol validation
   - Data consistency testing between protocols
   - Protocol switching capability verification
   - Client availability and compatibility checks

5. **Makefile Integration**:
   - `test-integration` - Full integration test suite
   - `test-load` - Standard load testing
   - `test-load-custom` - Customizable load testing with parameters
   - `test-failure-scenarios` - Failure scenario validation
   - `test-migration-compatibility` - Migration readiness testing
   - `test-phase6` - Complete Phase 6 test suite execution

**Key Testing Capabilities**:
- **Full System Validation**: End-to-end testing through Traefik gateway
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Baseline performance metrics establishment
- **Resilience Testing**: System behavior under various failure conditions
- **Migration Readiness**: Validation of dual-protocol operation
- **Automated Reporting**: Comprehensive test results and analysis
- **Configurable Parameters**: Flexible testing scenarios

**Test Results and Reporting**:
- Integration test reports in `test-results/integration/`
- Load test analysis in `test-results/load/`
- Failure scenario reports in `test-results/failure/`
- Migration compatibility reports in `test-results/migration/`

**Performance Baseline Achieved**:
- SET operations: 60+ ops/sec
- GET operations: 65+ ops/sec
- Concurrent operations: 10+ simultaneous users supported
- Error handling: Graceful degradation verified

### Phase 4: Traefik Gateway ✅ COMPLETE
**Deliverables**: Production-ready gateway with comprehensive middleware and monitoring
