- ✅ **Frame Validation**: Robust validation with detailed error handling
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: V0.1 constants maintained where needed
- ✅ **Service Compatibility Restored**: Fixed breaking changes for all existing services

#### Technical Achievements
- **ResponseStream API**: Enables partial responses and streaming data
- **WorkerResponseStream**: Worker-side streaming with SendPartial/SendFinal
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: 17+ error types with context and wrapping
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full adherence to MDP v0.2 specification
- **Test Coverage**: Protocol, reliability, and integration test suites
- **Message Validation**: Comprehensive frame validation for all message types
- **Service Compatibility**: All existing services (broker, identity, state) now working with v0.2

#### Breaking Changes Resolution
During the MDP v0.2 upgrade, several breaking changes were introduced that required immediate resolution:

**Issues Identified:**
- Services failing on startup with protocol validation errors
- Raw byte commands (`\x01`, `\x05`) instead of human-readable strings
- Incorrect validation function usage in worker-to-broker messages
- Memory issues and socket cleanup problems
- **Critical Post-Upgrade Issue**: Client-to-broker communication completely failed due to ZeroMQ frame structure mismatch

**Fixes Implemented:**
- ✅ **Command Constants**: Converted from `string(rune(0x01))` to `"READY"` format
- ✅ **Validation Functions**: Fixed worker to use `ValidateWorkerMessage` instead of `ValidateBrokerToWorkerMessage`
- ✅ **Protocol Compatibility**: Updated all services to use MDP v0.2 message format
- ✅ **Integration Testing**: Verified broker ↔ identity service connectivity
- ✅ **Frame Structure Fix**: Resolved critical client communication failure by adding empty delimiter frame to client messages (see `docs/reports/mdp-upgrade-issue-resolution.md`)

**Result**: All services now successfully connect and communicate using MDP v0.2 protocol with human-readable commands, proper frame validation, and complete client-broker communication functionality.
