# MDP Framing Issue Resolution Report

**Date**: June 16, 2025  
**Issue**: Client-Broker Communication Failure in MDP v0.2  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Priority**: Critical  

## Executive Summary

Following the MDP v0.2 protocol upgrade, client-to-broker communication completely failed while worker-to-broker communication continued functioning normally. The root cause was identified as inconsistent ZeroMQ frame structure processing between client and worker messages in the broker. This report documents the investigation methodology, root cause analysis, solution implementation, and verification results.

## Problem Statement

### Initial Symptoms
- ✅ **Worker Services**: Heartbeats and service registration working correctly
- ❌ **Client Communications**: All client requests (authentication, MMI queries) timing out
- ❌ **Authentication**: `./build/plant auth login` commands failing with timeouts
- ❌ **MMI Queries**: Management interface queries not responding

### Error Manifestations
```bash
# Client authentication attempts
$ ./build/plant auth login --email test@example.com --password password
Error: context deadline exceeded (30s timeout)

# MMI service queries  
$ go run test_mmi_query.go
Failed to receive MMI response: context deadline exceeded
```

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: Client messages reach broker and get routed to appropriate services
- **Actual**: Client connections succeed but messages never reach broker's message handlers

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Enhanced Debug Logging
**Objective**: Determine if client messages were reaching the broker at all

**Implementation**: Added comprehensive frame-level logging to `core/mdp/broker.go`:
```go
log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "total_frames":   len(frames),
    "raw_frames":     frames,
    "sender":         sender,
    "remaining_data": msg,
}).Debug("processing incoming message")
```

**Results**: 
- ✅ Worker heartbeat messages appearing in broker logs
- ❌ Zero client messages appearing in broker logs despite successful connections

### Phase 2: Direct Socket Testing
**Objective**: Verify basic ZeroMQ connectivity between client and broker

**Implementation**: Created raw DEALER socket test sending MMI queries directly:
```go
client, err := mdp.NewClient("tcp://127.0.0.1:9797")
err = client.Send("mmi.service", "org.plantd.Identity")
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Socket connections successful (no connection errors)
- ❌ No messages appearing in broker debug logs
- **Conclusion**: Fundamental message processing failure confirmed

### Phase 3: Frame Structure Analysis
**Objective**: Compare message construction between working (worker) and failing (client) components

**Worker Message Structure** (`core/mdp/worker.go`):
```go
// Workers include empty delimiter frame for DEALER socket routing
m[0] = ""                    // Empty delimiter frame
m[1] = MdpwWorker           // Protocol header: "MDPW02" 
m[2] = MdpwHeartbeat        // Command: "HEARTBEAT"
```

**Client Message Structure** (`core/mdp/client.go`):
```go
// Clients omit empty delimiter frame - MISSING!
req[0] = MdpcClient         // Protocol header: "MDPC02"
req[1] = MdpcRequest        // Command: "REQUEST"  
req[2] = service            // Service name
req[3] = data               // Request data
```

**Key Discovery**: Frame structure inconsistency identified between workers and clients.

### Phase 4: Broker Message Processing Analysis
**Objective**: Trace broker's message processing pipeline to understand frame expectations

**Broker Processing Pipeline** (`core/mdp/broker.go`):
```go
// Broker expects ALL DEALER messages to follow this pattern:
sender, msg := util.PopStr(msg)        // Pop sender ID
_, msg = util.PopStr(msg)             // Pop empty delimiter frame  
header, msg := util.PopStr(msg)       // Pop protocol header
```

**Frame Processing Results**:
- **Worker messages**: `[sender_id, "", "MDPW02", "HEARTBEAT"]` → header = "MDPW02" ✅
- **Client messages**: `[sender_id, "MDPC02", "REQUEST", "service"]` → header = "REQUEST" ❌

**Root Cause Identified**: Broker assumed all DEALER messages contained empty delimiter frame, but only workers included it.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Frame Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Inconsistent ZeroMQ DEALER socket frame structure between client and worker messages.

**Technical Details**:
1. **ZeroMQ DEALER Socket Behavior**: DEALER sockets automatically add sender identity frame
2. **Worker Implementation**: Correctly included empty delimiter frame after sender identity
3. **Client Implementation**: Omitted empty delimiter frame, starting directly with protocol header
4. **Broker Processing**: Assumed all messages had empty delimiter frame and processed accordingly

### Secondary Issue: Broker Message Routing Bug
**Problem**: Broker failed to strip command frame from client messages before routing to services.

**Technical Details**:
1. **Worker Message Processing**: Correctly stripped command frame before calling `WorkerMsg()`
2. **Client Message Processing**: Failed to strip command frame before calling `ClientMsg()`
3. **Service Expectations**: Services expected messages with command frame already removed
4. **Result**: Services received malformed messages with command frame intact

### Message Flow Comparison

#### Working Worker Flow:
```
Worker → Broker → Service
[sender, "", "MDPW02", "HEARTBEAT"] → strips command → ["HEARTBEAT"] → ✅ ProcessMessage()
```

#### Broken Client Flow (Before Fix):
```
Client → Broker → Service  
[sender, "MDPC02", "REQUEST", "service", "data"] → no command stripping → ["REQUEST", "service", "data"] → ❌ ProcessMessage()
```

## Solution Implementation

### Fix 1: Client Frame Structure Correction
**File**: `core/mdp/client.go`  
**Change**: Added empty delimiter frame to match worker message structure

```go
// Before (broken):
req[0] = MdpcClient         // "MDPC02"
req[1] = MdpcRequest        // "REQUEST"  
req[2] = service            // Service name
req[3] = data               // Request data

// After (fixed):
req[0] = ""                 // Empty delimiter frame
req[1] = MdpcClient         // "MDPC02"
req[2] = MdpcRequest        // "REQUEST"
req[3] = service            // Service name  
req[4] = data               // Request data
```

### Fix 2: Broker Command Frame Stripping
**File**: `core/mdp/broker.go`  
**Change**: Added command frame stripping for client messages to match worker processing

```go
// Added to client message processing:
switch header {
case MdpcClient:
    // Strip the command frame (should be "REQUEST" for MDP v0.2)
    if len(msg) < 1 {
        log.Error("client message missing command frame")
        continue
    }
    
    command, msg := util.PopStr(msg)
    log.WithFields(log.Fields{
        "sender":         sender,
        "command":        command,
        "message_frames": len(msg),
    }).Debug("routing to ClientMsg")
    
    // Validate command is REQUEST for MDP v0.2
    if command != MdpcRequest {
        log.WithFields(log.Fields{
            "sender":          sender,
            "expected_command": MdpcRequest,
            "received_command": command,
        }).Error("invalid client command")
        continue
    }
    
    b.ClientMsg(sender, msg)  // Now properly formatted
```

## Verification and Testing

### Test 1: MMI Service Query
**Objective**: Verify basic broker-client communication

```bash
$ go run test_mmi_query.go
Testing MMI service query...
MMI response: [200]
Testing identity service...  
Identity response: [200 {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-06-16T09:34:28.123Z","service":"identity","version":"v0.1.0"}]
```

**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - MMI queries working correctly

### Test 2: Authentication Request  
**Objective**: Verify end-to-end client-broker-service communication

```bash
$ ./build/plant auth login --email geoff.jay@gmail.com --password M1ntberrycrunch!
Login successful!
Access Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Refresh Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Full authentication workflow functioning

### Test 3: Debug Log Verification
**Objective**: Confirm proper message routing through debug logs

**Broker Logs** (showing successful client message processing):
```
broker | DEBU[2025-06-16 09:35:41] processing incoming message raw_frames="[sender_id  MDPC02 REQUEST auth login {...}]" total_frames=5
broker | DEBU[2025-06-16 09:35:41] extracted sender remaining_frames=4 sender="sender_id"  
broker | DEBU[2025-06-16 09:35:41] popped empty delimiter remaining_frames_after_delimiter=3
broker | DEBU[2025-06-16 09:35:41] extracted header for processing header=MDPC02 remaining_data="[REQUEST auth login {...}]"
broker | DEBU[2025-06-16 09:35:41] routing to ClientMsg command=REQUEST message_frames=2 sender="sender_id"
```

**Identity Service Logs** (showing successful message processing):
```
identity | DEBU[2025-06-16 09:35:41] received request command=REQUEST fields.msg="[sender_id auth login {...}]"
identity | INFO[2025-06-16 09:35:41] Processing MDP request operation=login service=identity.auth
identity | INFO[2025-06-16 09:35:42] Security event event_type=login_success email=geoff.jay@gmail.com success=true
identity | INFO[2025-06-16 09:35:42] MDP request completed operation=login service=identity.auth success=true
```

**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Messages properly routing through entire pipeline
