- **Quarterly**: Strategic alignment and course correction

## Quick Reference

### Critical Path Items
1. **Security Implementation** (Months 1-3) - Highest priority
2. **Identity Service** (Months 2-4) - Blocks many other features
3. **Testing Infrastructure** (Months 1-6) - Quality foundation
4. **Production Deployment** (Months 9-12) - Operational readiness

### Key Milestones
- **Month 3**: Basic security and identity implemented
