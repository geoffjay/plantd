# ðŸ¥¸ Identity Service

Idea stage, doesn't exist.

The purpose of this would be to function as a service that authorizes users,
and stores session information in a key value store. Many authentication
providers exist already, one of those should probably be used in favour of
rolling one manually. Ory Hydra is a good option for this.
