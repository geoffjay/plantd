After completing tasks you should review the [current-state.md](mdc:docs/analysis/current-state.md) document that's kept in `/docs/analysis/current-state.md`, specifically the "Service Maturity Matrix". If work has been done that is related to the service state in this matrix its value should be updated according to the options available in the legend.
