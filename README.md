# Plantd

Core services for building distributed control systems.

Pre-alpha state, might burn your house down, don't use.

## Purpose

So much of `plantd` related tooling has been spread apart, the purpose of this
project is to attempt to bring together the `go` services that are actually
used in the hopes that all the rest can be archived one day.

## Projects

### üèö Existing

The list of projects that should be brought into this one:

* [Broker][broker]
* [Command Line Client][plantcli]
* [Control Tool][plantctl]

### üè† Planned

* [Core](core/README.md)
* [Identity](identity/README.md)
* [Proxy](proxy/README.md)
* [State](state/README.md)

## Contributing
