# Plantd

Core services for building distributed control systems.

Pre-alpha state, might burn your house down, don't use.

## Purpose

So much of `plantd` related tooling has been spread apart, the purpose of this
project is to attempt to bring together the `go` services that are actually
used in the hopes that all the rest can be archived one day.

## Projects

### Existing

* [Broker][broker]
